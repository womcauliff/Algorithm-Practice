# Most Frequently Occurring Item in an Array

## Problem Description

> Find the most frequently occurring item in an array.
> Example: The most frequently occurring item in `[1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1]` is `1`.
> If you're given an empty array, you should return `null` (in Java) or `None` (in Python).
> You can assume that there is always a single, unique value that appears most frequently unless the array is empty. For instance, you won't be given an array such as `[1, 1, 2, 2]`.
> NOTE: Use lists instead of arrays in Python for simplicity.

## Solution

I've written a implementation that determines the solution in linear time complexity (`O(n)`).

Languages Implemented :

- [JavaScript](./solution.js)
- [Python](solution.py)
- [Java](solution.java)
